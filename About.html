    <main> 

<p> I am a Computer Science student at the Uttarakhand Technical university and my 1st&2nd year experience learning experience in engineering, I have seen that "The more I feel I have learnt something, there still exists some scope to make it better!!" Learning is never stopped.....
</p>

    I have a keep interest in python and data science . I have build many models using Python and GUI based in past 2year like:-
</p>

<li>Quiz game </li>
<li>Digital Watch </li>
<li>Random password Generator </li>

<p> I have build two models using HTML,CSS and Javascript based in 1month  like:-
</p>
<ul>

<p>  currently, I am working to enhance my skill set in the same . I have been involved in many college activities like coding club and Eco club....
